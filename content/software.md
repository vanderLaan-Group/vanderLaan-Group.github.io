The van der Laan group contributes state-of-the-art software for Targeted
Learning over a wide range of platforms, primarily using the [R language and
environment for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/) but also
occasionally in programming languages including Python, Julia, SAS, C++, and
Java.

[The tlverse](https://github.com/tlverse) software ecosystem is a centralized
effort to overhaul the state and availability of Targeted Learning software in
R. For a more general (but slightly dated) set of opensource software packages,
consider checking out the [UC Berkeley Biostatistics Software
Community](http://berkeleybiostats.github.io/).

The van der Laan Group GitHub organization is accessible [on
GitHub](https://github.com/vanderLaan-Group).

Software contributions are also routinely available on the GitHub profiles of
individual students.
