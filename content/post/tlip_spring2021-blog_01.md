## Answer:

Hi L.E.D.,

Thank you for the interesting question.

For concreteness, we observe `$O = (W, A, Y)$` where `$A$` is a continuous or
discrete-ordered variable (number of visits to healthcare per year). In
addition, there are some key variables in `$W$`, say `$V$`, that are known to be
important for achieving a high level of `$A$`. You then talk about an
intervention on `$V$` through another `$A_1$` variable making it easier to
achieve `$A$` for the person. It is like providing another incentive `$A_1$`
such as money, travel or bringing the service closer to them. Normally, `$W$`
has an arrow going into `$A_1$`, but this `$A_2$` is pre-`$V$`. So, the ordering
becomes `$(W, A_1, V, A_2, Y)$`. So, we now have a longitudinal two-timepoint
intervention data structure, and we are interested in two-timepoint
interventions `$(g^{\star}_1, g^{\star}_2)$` that optimize `$\mathbb{E}
Y_{g^{\star}}$`. You indicate a situation in which the ability to increase $A_2
= d(V)$ or $g^{\star}_{2 \mid V}$, to high levels is very much affected by how
`$A_1$` is set and thereby `$V$` is realized. Just as in cancer trials where we
h ave two-stage treatment regimen, first-line and second-line treatment.

If we restrict to shift interventions on `$A_2$`, then, depending on `$A_1$`, we
can push the shift further. So, we could define `$g^{\star}_{2,\delta}$` with
`$\delta$` chosen maximally in response to the value of `$V$`. Even though we
fix `$g^{\star}_2$` we still have flexibility in what variable among the `$V$`
components we intervene on. So, we really have a set `$(A_{1k}: k)$` of
treatment nodes for `$A_1$`, where `$k$` identifies which `$V_k$` we target with
this intervention.

So, we have `$(W, (A_1(k): k), V, A_2, Y)$`. We now want to consider, say, rules
`$d_{1k}(W)$` that intervene on `$A_1(k)$` with a rule targeting `$V_k$`. We
could consider regimens that only intervene on a single `$A_1(k)$`, and we are
then interested in not only optimizing `$d_{1k}(W)$` for a given `$k$` but also
in selecting among `$k$`, or, maybe even among joint interventions that target
subsets of `$A_1(k)$`. Given an observational data set, we could estimate the
mean outcome among a user-supplied class of such interventions or define optimal
rules `$d_{1k,P_0}(W)$` for each `$k$` and thus also an single optimal rule
`$d_0$` for `$A_1$`. We then want to learn that rule and, given that estimated
rule, we care about the mean outcome with respect to using that rule on `$A_1$`
and the corresponding shift `$g^{\star}_{2}$` on `$A_2$`. So, this falls in the
category of learning joint interventions from data and then performing a TMLE
for the corresponding target parameter, thus using CV-TMLE.

It is very much like making the choice of interventin on `$A_2$` a deterministic
function of the `$A_1$` intervention and then defining the optimal rule for
`$A_1$`. It avoids the notion of sequentially defined optimal rules, as in our
work with [Alex Luedtke](https://www.alexluedtke.com/) by making the second
treatment a deterministic function of the first -- quite interesting and
sensible. Overall, this certainly falls in the category of data-adaptive target
parameters defined by searching among subsets of variables of `$V$` and
corresponding rules based on data, using CV-TMLE as a general method for
inference.

If indeed one can already do some learning without outcome data then that
learning comes "for free," so that would not be bad either. However, I think you
have in mind that we can investigate how `$A_1$` affects `$V(A_1)$` but that is
in essence looking at the outcome, so it is informative since `$V$` is just one
of the time-dependent markers on the pathway to the final outcome. Maybe you are
getting at the point that one could learn an optimal rule or so for targeting
`$V$` only using data `$(W, A_1, V)$`, and, after having run that and set the
intervention on `$A_1$`, we consider the next problem of learning the rule for
`$A_2$` based on `$(W, V), A_2, Y$`. If indeed it is relatively cheap to measure
`$V$` and impact of `$A_1$` on `$V$`, then that would be an effective
experiment.

You also appear to talk about running actual trials. This falls then in the
category of adaptive sequential designs (i.e., reinforcement learning), such as
targeted adaptive design learning of the optimal rule. We have work on that,
including recent work by Aurelien Bibaut. There is still a lot of progress to be
made there, see also my lectures notes from the class on adaptive design (Public
Health 243D), covering topics such as being able to adapt to surrogate outcomes
so that one does not need to wait until outcomes are measured before being able
to adapt the randomization probabilities for next enrolled subject. A lot of
exciting and important research to do there.

Great questions.

Best Wishes,

Mark
