<u>**Answer:**</u>

Hi I.M., N.H., and R.P.,

We still start out with a well defined full data random variable
$X=(W,Y_0,Y_1)$ with some probability distribution $P_{X,0}$. In this case, the
design under our control might involve sampling from a marginal distribution
$g^*_W$ and a conditional distribution $g^*_A$ of $A$, given $W$.

$g^*_W$ is now not equal to the population distribution $Q_{W,0}$, but might
be a biased sample version of that. Our observed data structure of
$(W^*, A, Y) = (W^*, A, Y_A)$ has a probability distribution determined by
$q_0$, conditional distribution of $Y_a$, given $W$, and $g^*=(g^*_W, g^*_A)$,
and is given by
1. Sample $W^*$ from $g_{W^*}$,
2. sample $\{Y_0, Y_1\}$ from $q$,
3. sample $A$ from $g^*_a$, and
4. define $O = (W^*, A, Y = Y_A)$.

We could now define an oracle design for $g^*_0$, some $g^*_{q_0}$ that might
be defined by $q_Y$.

For example, it might define $g^*_W$ as sampling from the conditional
distribution of $W$, given $\mathbb{E}(Y_1 - Y_0 \mid W) > 0$, which corresponds
with only sampling subjects for which there is a positive treatment effect, and
one might define the oracle design $g^*_{A}$ as setting $A = 1$.

A target parameter of interest could be $\mathbb{E}Y_{g*_0}$, i.e., the mean
outcome of $Y$ if we would sample $O$ from $P_{q_0,g*_0}$. I would probably
first want to know how to estimate this quantity (may be $\mathbb{E}Y_{g*_0}
- \mathbb{E}Y_{g*_W,A=0}$, causal effect of treatment for optimal subgroup)
-- based on iid. sampling from a fixed design $P_{q_0,g_0}$, where $g_0$ could
be the actual distribution of $W$ combined with a standard RCT for $g_A$. This
now resembles estimation of the treatment effect among the optimal subgroup for
a fixed design and Alex and I have a paper on that.

Such an iid estimator, e.g., an iid TMLE of $\mathbb{E}Y_{g*}$ for a given
design $g*$ based on sampling from a fixed design $P_{q_0,g_0}$ would now be
a basis for estimation in an adaptive design where $O_i \sim P_{q_0,g_{0,i}}$ is
sampled using design $g_{0,i}$, changing with $i$, based on the available data
at the time point at which the unit for $O_i$ needs to be sampled.

Such an iid TMLE of $\mathbb{E}Y_{g*}$ for an iid design $P_{q_0,g_0}$ would
involve targeting an initial estimator of $q_0$ with a TMLE step using weighting
(e.g., in the loss or in the clever covariate) by $\frac{g*}{g_0} = \frac{(g*_W
g*_A)}{(g_{W,0} g_{A,0})}$.

We might now simply replace that weight by $\frac{g*}{g_i} = \frac{(g*_W
g*_A)}{g_{W,i}g_{A,i}}$ to obtain an IPTW--TMLE for the adaptive design sampling
$O_i$ from $P_{q_0,g_i}$. Generally, I do not see any reason why the whole
theory for sequential adaptive design would not apply to this setting as well.
It is an example of the general sequential adaptive design (see 2008 tech
report) in which now $(W,A)$ are the design variables that are generated by the
distribution set by the experimenter. In fact, in that technical report,
I present as one example an adaptive design on the sampling of $X$ in the
regression context.

Indeed, the choice of oracle design is in our hands, and, in particular, we can
refine what we view as the target subgroup who need to be treated. For example,
if treatment is always beneficial, we might define a subgroup by a resource
constraint (e.g., only 30% can be treated). One could imagine that a ranking of
the conditional treatment effect would result in the top 30% of covariate values
that are not fair w.r.t. subgroups, and one could then decide to define a rule
for treating that also takes into account fairness w.r.t. certain subgroups,
while, under both a fairness and resource constraint, optimizing the mean
outcome. That will then result in a different oracle design and the resulting
adaptive design will then learn that particular oracle design...

Best Wishes,
Mark
